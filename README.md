# Alien_Invasion
This is a basic shooting game made using python and pygame. 
This project is taken from Python Hands on Book written By Eric Matthes

This game is simply made just using Python and Pygame with the concept of OOPS!!!!
Everything that is used in this game is well made with different classes so that user can adjust the whole game according to their need.

# About this game!!!!!
This game is inspired from the 90's retro game called Galaza where aliens come to to destory earth and we have to destroy their ships to save the earth.

In this game user get 3 Lives which means they can get 3 chance to destroy them and if user lost all those lives then the game will be over.

User can shoot maximum 3 bullets at a time only. When all those 3 bullets hit to the alien ships or get away from screen which means when bullets disappeared from the screen after get fired then only the user can shoot next 3 bullets.

If the alien's ships hit with the user's ships then the game will restart automatically.

The user will get a score of 10 points only with every hit of bullets to alien ships.
On the very left side highest score made by user is shown and very left side the current score or point is shows.

## How to run this game????

First You need to make a virtual enviroment on your selected directory. The code is written below to make a virtual enviroment...!!!

<pre> python3 -m venv .venv </pre>

You can install all the requirements of modules and libraries using this code below:

<pre> pip3 install -r requirements.txt </pre>

Now pull the repository at your current directory. Code:

<pre> git clone ["HTTPS link"] </pre>

If you've already made a clone then try the code in the terminal:

<pre> git pull </pre>

to get most updated code in your local drives.

Now run the alien_invasion.py file directly and if it shows error like "pygame" module not found then run this game in an alternate way:

Go to the directory where all the files are there and type this command in the terminal:

<pre> python3 alien_invasion.py </pre>

How to control the game----------->>>

Use SPACEBAR to shoot the bullets (max 3 bullets at a time only)

Use LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN arrow keys to control the warship to move to left, right, up, and down.

Try to make more score possible.

If you want to control the speed or any other settings then must open the "settings.py" and change the bullet speed or alien speed in floating points as per your requirements...



Enjoy :)
